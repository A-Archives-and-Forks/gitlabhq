title: Use GitLab Duo Workflow in your IDE
---
To use Workflow in VS Code:

1. In VS Code, open the Git repository folder for your GitLab project.
   - You must check out the branch for the code you would like to change.
1. Open the command palette:
   - On macOS: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>
   - On Windows and Linux: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>.
1. Type `GitLab Duo Workflow` and select **GitLab: Show Duo Workflow**.
1. To create a workflow, select **New workflow**.
1. For **Task description**, specify a junior-level code task in detail,
   and then select **Start**.

After you describe your task, Workflow generates and executes on a plan to address it.
While it executes, you can pause or ask it to adjust the plan.
