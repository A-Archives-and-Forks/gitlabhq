title: Best practices for GitLab Duo Workflow
---
When you describe your task to Workflow, keep these tips in mind to get the best results:

- It works best within these conditions:
  - Code tasks on the level of a junior engineer.
  - Repositories up to medium size.
  - In the [supported languages](_index.md#supported-languages).
- Use mainly to work on small features or bugs.
- Be detailed with a clear definition of done.
- Try to add implementation examples, with commit or merge request IDs.
- Mention files by their names, and GitLab references by their IDs.
  For example, project, issue, or merge request IDs.
  For more information, see [context](context.md).
