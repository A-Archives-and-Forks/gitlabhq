You can use [GitLab compliance controls](_index.md#gitlab-compliance-controls) to help meet the requirements of many
compliance standards.

The [Compliance Adherence Templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/software-supply-chain-security/compliance/engineering/compliance-adherence-templates) project
contains a library of JSON templates. Use these templates to quickly adopt predefined compliance frameworks.

## ISMAP compliance requirements

The Information system Security Management and Assessment Program (ISMAP) aims to secure the security level of the government's cloud service procurement
by evaluating and registering cloud services that meet the security requirements of the government in advance, thereby contributing to the smooth introduction
of cloud services.

The following table lists the requirements supported by GitLab for ISMAP and the controls for the requirements.

| 1.3.4 To what extent is it ensured that only evaluated and approved software is used for processing the organization's information assets? | Information processing is mostly done using of specific software. Security issues in software can become a risk for the information processed. Accordingly, software must be appropriately managed. Software is approved before installation or use. The software repositories are protected against unauthorized manipulation. Approval of software is regularly reviewed. Software versions and patch levels are known.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | <ul><li>Dependency scanning running</li><li>Container scanning running</li><li>License compliance running</li> |

Information security requirements for changes to the organization, business processes, and IT systems are determined and applied. A formal approval procedure is established.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | <ul><li>Default branch protected</li></ul> |

Exploitation of vulnerabilities is among the possible ways for attackers to gain access to the IT system or to threaten its operating stability. Information on technical vulnerabilities for the IT systems in use is gathered (for example, information from the manufacturer, system audits, CVS database) and evaluated. For example, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Potentially affected IT systems and software are identified, assessed and any vulnerabilities are addressed.                                                            | <ul><li>Dependency scanning running</li><li>Container scanning running</li></ul> |
