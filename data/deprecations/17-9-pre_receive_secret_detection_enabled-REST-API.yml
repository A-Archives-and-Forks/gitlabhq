   The REST API endpoint `pre_receive_secret_detection_enabled` is deprecated in favor of `secret_push_protection_enabled`. We are renaming some API fields to reflect the name change of the feature `pre_receive_secret_detection` to `secret_push_protection`.
   Following [new guidance](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/api_styleguide/#what-to-do-instead-of-a-breaking-change), we will adapt the schema to support both `pre_receive_secret_detection_enabled` and `secret_push_protection_enabled`. We will still [remove](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/512996) the old `pre_receive_secret_detection_enabled` column, but customers will be able to use either parameter, with both pointing to the new `secret_push_protection_enabled` column.
