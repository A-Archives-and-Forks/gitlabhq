# Important: These patterns match across multiple lines in the job logs.

# Each pattern uses a comma to separate the different parts that must appear in the log, but not necessarily on the same line.
failure_categories:
  rspec_valid_rspec_errors_or_flaky_tests:
    description: |
      Legitimate RSpec test failures that indicate actual code issues or flaky tests, as opposed to infrastructure problems.

      These include expectation failures (expected vs. got), assertion failures, and other test-specific errors. The patterns
      match logs that contain both the 'Failed examples:' section and either expectation outputs or general failure messages.

      When you see this failure category, it likely means there's an actual issue with the code or tests that needs to be
      addressed, rather than a CI infrastructure problem.
    patterns:
      - "Failed examples:,expected\\(:| # | \\[\\)"
      - "Failed examples:,Failure/Error:"

  jest:
    description: |
      JavaScript test failures in Jest framework, which is used for testing GitLab's frontend components.

      These failures indicate issues in the JavaScript/Vue code rather than infrastructure problems. The patterns match
      logs showing Jest test suite completion followed by a non-zero exit code, typically from assertion failures,
      timeouts, or errors in the test code itself.
    patterns:
      - "Ran all test suites,Command failed with exit code 1"
      - "Ran all test suites,exited with status 1"

  danger:
    description: |
      Failures in the Danger code review tool, which automatically checks merge requests for common issues.

      These failures typically indicate that the MR doesn't meet GitLab's contribution guidelines in some way. The pattern
      matches logs containing both authentication token references and error outputs from Danger's validation checks.

      Common Danger failures include:
      - Commit message formatting issues
      - Missing documentation updates
      - Missing changelog entries
      - Large merge requests that should be split
      - Missing test coverage

      Danger failures should be addressed before merging as they help maintain code quality standards.
